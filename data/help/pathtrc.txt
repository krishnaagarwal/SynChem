PathTrc displays a more intuitive synthetic rendition of a path selected
from the Syn_View PST.  When there are branches to the path (meaning that
the synthesis of co-reactants may be necessary to complete the synthesis
of the target compound), these will be prepended to the principal pathway
and terminated by a semicolon.  A one-time message will appear to indicate
the reaction step where the co-reactant branch joins a pathway of higher
precedence.

The last compound on the principal path (i.e., the target compound) and on
each co-reactant branch is highlighted in green.  The co-reactant molecule
also appears in green at the reaction step where it joins a higher precedence
pathway. Available compounds are highlighted in blue wherever they appear.

In order for PathTrc to understand the context of the path file, it must be
saved in PathTrc-friendly format.  To ensure this, the target compound itself
must be marked.  When this criterion is satisfied, any marked node which is
not along a continuous branch descending from the target will be ignored.
Also, you must explicitly mark available compounds that are to be included
in the PathTrc display, with the exception that any compound that is a
co-reactant to a marked node will be included automatically.  However, it
does no harm to mark every node to be displayed, even those that need not
be marked, because the program logic will work correctly either way.

When running PathTrc from the Syn_View menu option Path->View, just as when
running it as a standalone program, you must write any newly-selected path
to the pathfile (click on Path->Write) before bringing up PathTrc.
