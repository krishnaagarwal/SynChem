ALSMR predates the screening of small-ring alkynes and allenes in the COMPOK test.
Its main purpose now is to continue to support those schemata for which it had been
included as a posttransform condition prior to the COMPOK enhancement.

ALKYNE/ALLENE Menu (select one)

Node Fields (accept a pair of node numbers that defined both the alkyne/allene
	and the ring, if any)

IS/IS NOT Menu (select one)

Mark for Deletion/Undelete button:
	Toggles deletion mark on and off.  Irreversible deletion does not occur until
	exit from the main posttransform test editor.  Note that any condition that
	appears in the logic string of one or more tests may not be deleted (button
	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

Exit and Update Postran Buffer button:
	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
