EVERY/NOT EVERY Menu (select one)

HYDROGENS-BEARING NODE/NODE Menu:
	For most better-known examples, HYDROGEN-BEARING NODE will be specified;
	however, the alternative is provided in recognition that substituted positions
	(sulfonated sites, for example) are sometimes known to undergo substitution as
	well.

Node Field (enter the node number of a carbon atom whose equivalence to competing
	nodes is to be determined)

Mark for Deletion/Undelete button:
	Toggles deletion mark on and off.  Irreversible deletion does not occur until
	exit from the main posttransform test editor.  Note that any condition that
	appears in the logic string of one or more tests may not be deleted (button
	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

Exit and Update Postran Buffer button:
	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
