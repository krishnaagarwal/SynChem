The ARNOD condition type is of limited usefulness on its own; however, used as a
prescreen for the more sophisticated ARSTD, ARRAT, ARCET, and ARTIE, conditions,
it enables the posttransform program module to bypass cases which the latter are
as yet unprepared to handle with any degree of confidence.

EXISTS/DOES NOT EXIST Menu (select one)

Node Field (enter the node number of a carbon atom whose membership in a benzene
	ring is to be determined)
Note: While it may seem obvious at first glance that the pattern itself will determine
	the result of this condition, it is possible, through the use of variable
	bonds, to define a pattern that will match both isolated and fused aromatic
	ring systems.

Mark for Deletion/Undelete button:
	Toggles deletion mark on and off.  Irreversible deletion does not occur until
	exit from the main posttransform test editor.  Note that any condition that
	appears in the logic string of one or more tests may not be deleted (button
	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

Exit and Update Postran Buffer button:
	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
