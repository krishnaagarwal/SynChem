ARRAT differs from ARSTD in that it only measures the activation at a given site,
without ranking it as a competitor with other sites on the ring.

Node Field (enter the node number of a carbon atom whose absolute activation toward
	electrophilic aromatic substitution is to be determined)

IS/IS NOT Menu (select one)

Comparison Operator Menu (select one)

Constant Menu:
	Select a value that seems appropriate to the context of the condition.  Note
	that these values should be considered to be qualitative approximations, which
	may need fine tuning up or down for best overall fit on the basis of actual
	posttransform test results.  This fit should be checked through the use of a
	range of representative validation test examples. 

ONLY HYDROGENS/ALL SUBSTITUENTS Menu:
	For most better-known examples, ONLY HYDROGENS will be selected; however, the
	alternative is provided in recognition that substituted positions (sulfonated
	sites, for example) are sometimes known to undergo substitution as well.

Mark for Deletion/Undelete button:
	Toggles deletion mark on and off.  Irreversible deletion does not occur until
	exit from the main posttransform test editor.  Note that any condition that
	appears in the logic string of one or more tests may not be deleted (button
	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

Exit and Update Postran Buffer button:
	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
