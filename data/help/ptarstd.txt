While ARSTD may appear at first glance to be nearly identical to ARRAT, the difference
is that ARSTD is unconcerned with the degree of activation at a site - its purpose is
to compare the site against potentially competing sites on the ring.

Node Field (enter the node number of a carbon atom whose relative activation toward
	electrophilic aromatic substitution is to be determined)

IS/IS NOT Menu (select one)

Comparison Operator Menu (select one)
Note: The comparison operator will often be the opposite of what seems intuitive,
	because the number 1 is less than (<) the number 2, but the activation
	represented by 1 is greater than the activation represented by 2.  For
	example, an activation that is less than 2 (<2) implies an activation
	of 1, i.e., the most activated ranking.

Constant Menu:
	Select the value appropriate to the context of the condition, using a value of
	1 to denote the most activated position and 6 the least.

ONLY HYDROGENS/ALL SUBSTITUENTS Menu:
	For most better-known examples, ONLY HYDROGENS will be selected; however, the
	alternative is provided in recognition that substituted positions (sulfonated
	sites, for example) are sometimes known to undergo substitution as well.

Mark for Deletion/Undelete button:
	Toggles deletion mark on and off.  Irreversible deletion does not occur until
	exit from the main posttransform test editor.  Note that any condition that
	appears in the logic string of one or more tests may not be deleted (button
	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

Exit and Update Postran Buffer button:
	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
