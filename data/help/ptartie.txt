HYDROGENS-BEARING NODES/NODES Menu:
	For most better-known examples, HYDROGEN-BEARING NODES will be specified;
	however, the alternative is provided in recognition that substituted positions
	(sulfonated sites, for example) are sometimes known to undergo substitution as
	well.

	counted)

	as the one referenced above, while 6 means that all nodes are equally activated.

	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
