Node Fields:
	Accept a pair of variable node numbers which define the potential carbonium
	ion under consideration.  These nodes are a pair of substituents on a carbon
	atom whose electronic effects combine to determine the degree of stabilizing
	electron donation.  (The reason two nodes are used in this definition arises
	from its most common use with olefinic subgoal patterns to determine the
	most likely point of addition.  Another instance of this condition applies
	to a subgoal pattern containing a vicinal diol, where again, only two nodes
	contribute to either carbonium candidate.)

Comparison Node Fields:
	Select a pair of nodes whose electronic effects on a second carbonium ion
	determine a stability to serve as a comparison reference for that of the
	incipient carbonium ion affected by the pair of nodes entered above.

Mark for Deletion/Undelete button:
	Toggles deletion mark on and off.  Irreversible deletion does not occur until
	exit from the main posttransform test editor.  Note that any condition that
	appears in the logic string of one or more tests may not be deleted (button
	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

Exit and Update Postran Buffer button:
	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
