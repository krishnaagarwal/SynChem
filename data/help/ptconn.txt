Node Fields (accept a pair of variable atom node numbers whose external connection
	is to be determined)

EXISTS/DOES NOT EXIST/IS/IS NOT Menu (select EXISTS or DOES NOT EXIST to test for
	simple connectivity of any length, in which case all subsequent menus and
	fields will disappear; otherwise, select IS or IS NOT)
Note: Selecting IS or IS NOT will cause the name of the condition to change from
	[simple] CONN[ectivity] to R[i]NGS[i]Z[e].  This is merely reflective of
	the fact that the most common use of the condition is in defining cyclic
	structures.  It is not intended to restrict it to that use.

Comparison Operator Menu (select one)

total/path Menu:
	If "a total of" is selected, a bond-length count field will follow; otherwise
	a pair of fields for entry of the comparison nodes will follow, and the name
	of the condition will change from R[i]NGS[i]Z[e] to R[i]NGC[om]P[arison].

Bond Length Count Field (enter the number that, when added to the internal bond count
	between the nodes, if any, will total the appropriate ring size, or will
	otherwise correctly describe the connection between two separate goal pattern
	pieces)
Comparison Node Fields (select a pair of nodes whose connection length is to serve as
	a comparison reference for the path between the pair of nodes entered above)

Mark for Deletion/Undelete button:
	Toggles deletion mark on and off.  Irreversible deletion does not occur until
	exit from the main posttransform test editor.  Note that any condition that
	appears in the logic string of one or more tests may not be deleted (button
	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

Exit and Update Postran Buffer button:
	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
