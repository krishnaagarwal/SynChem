Node field (accepts two or more (up to a maximum of seven) node numbers to be
	tested for mutual equivalence within the context of this condition)

ARE/ARE NOT Menu (select one)

CONSTITUTIONALLY/STEREOCHEMICALLY EQUIVALENT Menu (select the appropriate constraint
	for this condition)

SUBGOAL/GOAL/DISCONNECTED Menu:
	The DISCONNECTED option, while seldom used, provides the flexibility to
	determine that two or more substituents are of identical structure, despite
	the possibility that their respective neighbors in either pattern would
	otherwise prevent their structural equivalence from being recognized; of
	the patterns, the subgoal is the one more likely to be useful, since a
	degree of symmetry in a reactant - while a source of complication for a
	computer application - tends to be a simplifying factor in the view of
	the chemist.

Mark for Deletion/Undelete button:
	Toggles deletion mark on and off.  Irreversible deletion does not occur until
	exit from the main posttransform test editor.  Note that any condition that
	appears in the logic string of one or more tests may not be deleted (button
	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

Exit and Update Postran Buffer button:
	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
