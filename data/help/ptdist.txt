Directed Attribute Menu:
	Selecting this menu brings up a scrollable selection list of directed
	attributes.  A directed attribute differs from a functional group in that
	an instance of the former is valid only if the point of attachment is the
	specific atomic node that has been defined for it.  The drawings of these
	attributes (within a window that may be called up from the selection list)
	designate these points of attachment with a box, in the same way that the
	root nodes are designated in the functional group drawings.  The current
	selection is highlighted until another group is selected to take its place
	in the condition statement.

Presence Menu (select "IS" or "IS NOT")

Distance Field (normally 0, but may be modified to accomodate special cases)

NODE field (accepts a node number obtainable by reference to the numbered transform
	patterns in the main posttransform display)

Mark for Deletion/Undelete button:
	Toggles deletion mark on and off.  Irreversible deletion does not occur until
	exit from the main posttransform test editor.  Note that any condition that
	appears in the logic string of one or more tests may not be deleted (button
	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

Exit and Update Postran Buffer button:
	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
