Functional Group Menu:
        Selecting this menu brings up a scrollable selection list of functional
        groups, from which a window containing drawings of these groups may be
        called up.  The current selection is highlighted until another group is
        selected to take its place in the condition statement.

SUBGOAL/GOAL Menu:
	The subgoal is the one more likely to be useful, since a degree of symmetry
	in a reactant - while a source of complication for a computer application -
	tends to be a simplifying factor in the view of the chemist.

IS/IS NOT Menu (select one)

CONSTITUTIONALLY/STEREOCHEMICALLY EQUIVALENT Menu (select the appropriate constraint
	for this condition)

Mark for Deletion/Undelete button:
	Toggles deletion mark on and off.  Irreversible deletion does not occur until
	exit from the main posttransform test editor.  Note that any condition that
	appears in the logic string of one or more tests may not be deleted (button
	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

Exit and Update Postran Buffer button:
	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
