pH Menu (selects the pH conditions relevant to the reaction to which the condition
	applies)

EXISTS/DOES NOT EXIST Menu (select one)

Distance Field (typically 0, but may be modified as appropriate to suit a specific
	transform)

Node Field (accepts a node number which defines the potential leaving group)

Comparison Operator Menu (select one)

Comparison Node Fields (select a pair of nodes whose carbonium ion stability will
	serve as a comparison reference for the ion defined by the pair of nodes
	entered above)

VALUE/LEAVING CROUP Menu (if VALUE is selected, only a numeric value menu will appear;
	otherwise, a second set of fields and menus for distance, node, and pH will
	be presented)

Numeric Value Menu (select the number corresponding to the best rating description)

Comparison Distance Field (see comment under "Distance Field" above)

Comparison Node Field (accepts a node number to define a potentially competing group)

Mark for Deletion/Undelete button:
	Toggles deletion mark on and off.  Irreversible deletion does not occur until
	exit from the main posttransform test editor.  Note that any condition that
	appears in the logic string of one or more tests may not be deleted (button
	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

Exit and Update Postran Buffer button:
	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
