Functional Group Menu:
        Selecting this menu brings up a scrollable selection list of functional
        groups, from which a window containing drawings of these groups may be
        called up.  The current selection is highlighted until another group is
        selected to take its place in the condition statement.

	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
