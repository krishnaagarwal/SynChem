The NUMBER OF STEPS IN DISPLAYED SYNTHESIS comprises all reaction steps
that were selected and marked to be saved in a path file, including
those in prepended co-reactant branches.

The value reported for CONFIDENCE is the lowest estimated individual
reaction confidence encountered in traversing all of the pathways in
the display.  The rationale for this assessment is the presumption that
one can have no more confidence in the soundness of the complete synthesis
proposal than can be ascribed to the least reliable reaction step.  

AVERAGE VALUE OF EASE PER STEP is a very rough heuristic estimate which,
together with the number of reaction steps in the synthesis, can provide
a measure for comparing the relative desirability of different solutions
for the same target compound in the same search space.  Beyond serving in
this comparative capacity, it has little intrinsic significance.

The PROJECTED YIELD ALONG the PRINCIPAL PATHWAY ignores the degradation
in yield along any co-reactant synthesis branches prepended to the
principal pathway.  In effect, the yield estimate assumes that the
starting material and co-reactants along the principal pathway are
either available compounds or are easily synthesized.  Should this value
fall below five percent (5%), it will simply be represented as "LOW".
