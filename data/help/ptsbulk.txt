NODE/EDGE Menu:
	1) If NODE is selected, the user will specify a variable node whose bulk
	   is to be assessed for the comparison that defines this condition.
	2) If EDGE is selected, two neighboring nodes are specified.  The second
	   node defines a fragment whose bulk is to be determined, and its bond
	   to the first is the one whose cleavage defines the end of the fragment.

Node field(s) (accepts one or a pair of node numbers - depending on the value of
	the preceding menu - which are obtainable by reference to the numbered
	transform patterns in the main posttransform display)

IS/IS NOT Menu (select one)

GREATER THAN/LESS THAN Menu (select one)

GROUP/NODE/EDGE Menu:
	If "GROUP" is selected, a group menu will follow; otherwise one or a pair of
	node fields will follow.  (See explanation of EDGE above.)

Group Menu (select the group that most closely approximates the desired bulk)
Node field(s) (select node or pair for comparison with node or pair entered above)

Mark for Deletion/Undelete button:
	Toggles deletion mark on and off.  Irreversible deletion does not occur until
	exit from the main posttransform test editor.  Note that any condition that
	appears in the logic string of one or more tests may not be deleted (button
	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

Exit and Update Postran Buffer button:
	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
