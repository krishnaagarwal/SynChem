Functional Group Menu:
	Selecting this menu brings up a scrollable selection list of functional
	groups, from which a window containing drawings of these groups may be
	called up.  The current selection is highlighted until another group is
	selected to take its place in the condition statement.

Presence/Occurrence Menu:
	Selecting "OCCURS AT LEAST ..." or "DOES NOT OCCUR AT LEAST ..." introduces a
	field to accept an appropriate number of instances of the functional group.
	This field becomes superfluous and therefore disappears when either "IS" or
	"IS NOT" is selected.

NODE field:
	Accepts a variable node number obtainable by reference to the numbered
	transform patterns in the main posttransform display.  The node selected
	is the one presumed to contain the functional-group fragment of interest.

Mark for Deletion/Undelete button:
	Toggles deletion mark on and off.  Irreversible deletion does not occur until
	exit from the main posttransform test editor.  Note that any condition that
	appears in the logic string of one or more tests may not be deleted (button
	will be disabled) so long as any of those tests remain unmarked.

Exit and Update Postran Buffer button:
	Exiting in this way will cause the main posttransform test editor to update
	according the the addition or modification in the current condition.

Cancel button:
	Quitting via the Cancel button will cause any interactions with this editor
	to be discarded and a return to the unchanged main posttransform display.
