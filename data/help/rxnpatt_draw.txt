Edit Mode buttons:
	1) draw: enables "rubber-band" connection of atoms to one another
	2) select: enables freehand drawing of an enclosed area around part of a
	   drawn molecule, usually for wholesale deletion
	3) select root: opens a list of synthemes, from which a list of drawings
	   containing an enclosed root atom can be called up; after a syntheme
	   is selected, the cursor becomes a plus-sign and can be used to select
	   an appropriate atom in the goal pattern (see notes below for rules and
	   tactics in selecting from amongs several candidate nodes)
	4) delete: changes drawing cursor to "skull-and-crossbones," which when
	   placed over an atom or a bond highlights it for deletion when the left
	   mouse button is clicked.  (Deletion of an atom deletes all incident
	   bonds as well.)
	5) delete root: changes cursor to an asterisk, which can be used to
	   select an atom to be removed from the root/syntheme list
Notes about root/syntheme selection:
	1) There must be exactly one root for each separate piece of the goal
	   pattern, not including lone disconnected atoms.
	2) At least one syntheme must correspond to the chapter of which the schema
	   is a member.
	3) When more than one atom qualifies as a root, the best choice is the one
	   that is closest to being unique and therefore constrained by its
	   neighboring atoms to match the fewest nodes in a given target molecule.

Edit Options buttons:
	1) select all: draws an enclosure around the entire molecular drawing
	2) delete selected: deletes all atoms and bonds enclose by the selection area

Atoms buttons (change current atom identity - selecting "other" brings up a periodic
	table - the button set includes special symbols: R for a general variable;
	R' for a non-H variable; . (period) for a lone electron; : (colon) for an
	electron pair; X for a generic halogen)

Bonds buttons (change multiplicity of last-drawn bond - includes single- and double-
	dashed bonds: single-dashed for a variable bond, which will match either
	single, double, or resonant bonds; double-dashed for a resonant bond, which
	must be used when drawing benzene ring systems in a transform, so that any
	alternate single- and double-bond canonical forms conforming to Hueckel's
	rule will be recognized)

Goal and Subgoal Pattern Drawing Areas:
	1) use left or middle button to lay down an atom (C by default)
	2) if necessary, change the atom ID with the appropriate Atoms button
	3) lay down a bond to the next atom by moving to the position and pressing
	   either the left (single-bonding) or middle (double-bonding) button
	4) if necessary, change the bond order with the appropriate Bonds button
	5) to move without adding or modifying a bond, press the right ("escape")
	   button
	6) when a new pattern is being entered (or after the drawing areas have been
	   cleared), drawing actions in either panel will be duplicated in the other;
	   when an existing pattern is being modified (or after the patterns have
	   been isolated), only the addition of atoms is reflected in the currently
	   inactive area, and bonds must be added or modified explicitly in each
	7) hydrogens on carbon need not be specified, as the logic of the editor
	   will automatically supply them as needed to complete the transforms
	   upon exit
Note 1: When the cursor is within connecting distance of an atom, it is changed to a
	solid green box to confirm for the user that the atom has been targeted.
Note 2: After the goal pattern or the subgoal pattern - whichever was first entered -
	is complete, the two should be isolated (see Isolate button below), so that
	the structural change to be defined by the transform can be specified.

Roots & Synthemes window (lists all roots defined for the goal pattern, along with
	their respective synthemes)

Exit; Update Buffer button (updates schema transform from contents of drawing areas
	and closes editor window)

Quit and Cancel button (closes editor window without altering schema transform)

isolate button (when entering a transform from scratch, initially both patterns
	slave one another; once the initial pattern - goal or subgoal - is complete,
	isolating the patterns makes it possible to modify each independently in
	terms of bonding - additional atoms will still appear in both patterns,
	but the bonds will not unless explicitly drawn)

toggle # button (allows the user to decide whether node numbers are shown)

redraw button (cleans up drawings by showing - usually - more pleasing template-
	generated renditions)

clear button (erases drawing areas to create patterns from scratch)
