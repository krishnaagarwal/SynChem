Edit Mode buttons:
	1) draw: enables "rubber-band" connection of atoms to one another
	2) select: enables freehand drawing of an enclosed area around part of a
	   drawn molecule, usually for wholesale deletion
	3) add functional groups: opens a list of functional groups for inclusion
	   or exclusion from either the goal pattern or the subgoal pattern.  The
	   selections will appear on the left side of the appropriate drawing area.
	4) delete: changes drawing cursor to "skull-and-crossbones," which when
	   placed over an atom or a bond highlights it for deletion when the left
	   mouse button is clicked.  (Deletion of an atom deletes all incident
	   bonds as well.)

Edit Options buttons:
	1) select all: draws an enclosure around the entire molecular drawing
	2) delete selected: deletes all atoms and bonds enclose by the selection area

Atoms buttons (change current atom identity - selecting "other" brings up a periodic
	table - the button set includes special symbols: R for a general variable;
	R' for a non-H variable; . (period) for a lone electron; : (colon) for an
	electron pair; X for a generic halogen)

Bonds buttons (change multiplicity of last-drawn bond - includes single- and double-
	dashed bonds: single-dashed for a variable bond, which will match either
	single, double, or resonant bonds; double-dashed for a resonant bond, which
	must be used when drawing benzene ring systems in a transform, so that any
	alternate single- and double-bond canonical forms conforming to Hueckel's
	rule will be recognized)

Goal and Subgoal Pattern Drawing Areas:
	1) use left or middle button to lay down an atom (C by default)
	2) if necessary, change the atom ID with the appropriate Atoms button
	3) lay down a bond to the next atom by moving to the position and pressing
	   either the left (single-bonding) or middle (double-bonding) button
	4) if necessary, change the bond order with the appropriate Bonds button
	5) to move without adding or modifying a bond, press the right ("escape")
	   button
	6) unlike the transform editor, the fragment editor does not maintain any
	   atom mapping between the two patterns.  In fact, the atoms defined for
	   one are hidden within the other, at least until and unless a redraw is
	   done.  Even then, the use of the same atom in both patterns is to be
	   discouraged, as the results are somewhat unpredictable.
	7) the fragments should be made with sufficient detail to minimize the
	   occurrence of irrelevant matches, but without excessive detail that
	   could be too specific to match all the relevant patterns
Note: When the cursor is within connecting distance of an atom, it is changed to a
	solid green box to confirm for the user that the atom has been targeted.

Exit; start Search button (begins IsThere search with the combination of fragments
	and functional groups specified in this editor)

Quit and Cancel button (closes editor window and abandons IsThere search)

toggle # button (allows the user to decide whether node numbers are shown)

redraw button (cleans up drawings by showing - usually - more pleasing template-
	generated renditions; as a side effect, also makes hidden atoms visible)

clear button (erases drawing areas to create patterns from scratch)
