File menu:
	1) Open - submit ... (brings up a file selection window positioned within the
	   submit directory - select a file from which the sling and other data are
	   to be read and displayed)
	2) Open - status ... (brings up a file selection window positioned within the
	   status directory - select a file from which the sling and other data are
	   to be read and displayed)
	3) Save - draw_string_template ... (writes file named in Run ID box to contain
	   text from User, Date, Comment and Sling boxes - be sure to fill in Run Id
	   and Comment, and update Sling by clicking Done button prior to saving)

Draw button: restores the last molecule drawing submitted during this session.

draw_sling_templates button: brings up a file selection window positioned within the
	draw_sling_template directory - select a file from which the sling and other
	data are to be read and displayed)

Reset button (seldom used in validation implementation): clears drawing window and
	restores other fields to their defaults

Edit Mode buttons:
	1) draw: enables "rubber-band" connection of atoms to one another
	2) select: enables freehand drawing of an enclosed area around part of a
	   drawn molecule, usually for wholesale deletion
	3) delete: changes drawing cursor to "skull-and-crossbones," which when
	   placed over an atom or a bond highlights it for deletion when the left
	   mouse button is clicked

Edit Options buttons:
	1) select all: draws an enclosure around the entire molecular drawing
	2) delete selected: deletes all atoms and bonds enclose by the selection
	   area

Atoms buttons (change current atom identity - selecting "other" brings up a periodic
	table)

Bonds buttons (change multiplicity of last-drawn bond)

Drawing Area:
	1) use left or middle button to lay down an atom (C by default)
	2) if necessary, change the atom ID from the appropriate Atoms button
	3) lay down a bond to the next atom by moving to the position and pressing
	   either the left (single) or middle (double) button
	4) if necessary, change the bond order from the appropriate Bonds button
	5) to move without adding or modifying a bond, press the right button

done button (updates Sling box from contents of drawing area)

redraw button (cleans up drawing by showing a - usually - more pleasing template-
	generated rendition)

clear button (erase drawing area)

submit button (accepts molecule as defined by drawing for validation process)

cancel button (bypass validation process)

reset button (seems to be the same as Reset button!?!?)
